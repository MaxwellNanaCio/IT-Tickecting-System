## Key Features:

### Ticket Management

- Tickets are categorized and prioritized based on severity and impact
- Automated ticket assignment and routing to the appropriate IT support team
- Real-time ticket status updates and notifications

### Incident Tracking
- Ability to log and track internet downtime incidents
- Automated alerts and notifications for IT administrators
- Detailed incident reports and analytics

### Reporting and Analytics
- Comprehensive reporting on ticket trends, resolution times, and user satisfaction
- Customizable dashboards and data visualizations
- Insights to help optimize IT support processes and resource allocation

### Mobile Accessibility
- Users can access the app and submit tickets on-the-go using their mobile devices
- IT support staff can respond to and manage tickets remotely

This IT Ticketing and Incident Management app is designed to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of IT support services, enhance user experience, and provide valuable data-driven insights to IT teams.
